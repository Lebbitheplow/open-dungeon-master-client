/**
 * Where the unpacked server lives and how a new payload replaces it without
 * ever holding the only copy of player data in a folder that is about to be
 * deleted. Layout under the app's files dir:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   server/       the live tree; odm-payload.json inside it is the commit marker
 *   server.new    a payload being unpacked; complete once its marker exists
 *   server.old    the previous tree during the swap, deleted last
 *   server.keep   what the older copy-based upgrade used; merged back if found
 * </pre>
 *
 * An upgrade unpacks into server.new (marker written last), moves the
 * PRESERVED folders across with rename (same filesystem, so no copy),
 * renames server to server.old and server.new to server, then deletes
 * server.old. {@link #recover()} runs before every start and finishes or
 * unwinds whatever an earlier run left behind. Pure java.io so it can be
 * unit tested on a temp directory.
