</div>

These are the **desktop and Android apps for
[Open Dungeon Master](https://github.com/Lebbitheplow/open-dungeon-master)**, the
multiplayer D&amp;D 5e table with an AI (or human) Dungeon Master. Every app carries
a complete Open Dungeon Master server inside it, so **you do not need a server to
play**: install the app, open your world, and share a room code with your friends.
When you do have a server, the app connects to it (or to any number of them) as well.

The rules engines, the AI Dungeon Master and the game screens all come from the
[server repository](https://github.com/Lebbitheplow/open-dungeon-master); this
repository is the shell around them. It runs the bundled server on your machine or
phone, opens a public address for it when you share, installs a local AI if your
computer can carry one, and draws the game screens natively for whichever host you
play on.

## A world on your device

Every build carries the Open Dungeon Master server, built from the server repository
at release time, and runs it privately on your device:

- **Desktop** starts it as a child process from the app's data folder the first time
  you enter your world. Your first visit asks for a name and signs you in; there is
  no password to remember on your own world.
- **Android** runs the same server on a Node 24 runtime built for Android, with the
  phone's built-in SQLite engine. A foreground notification shows while the world is
  shared, and **Stop hosting** in that notification ends the share.

Your world stays offline until you share it. Opening a campaign lobby starts sharing
automatically: the app asks the Open Dungeon Master broker for a public
`play-CODE.opendungeonmaster.com` address, runs `cloudflared` to it, and hands out a
room code. The code never changes for that table; it only works while you are
sharing. Voice chat relays through Cloudflare TURN, so it works across networks
without opening ports either.

Desktop and Android behave the same way on purpose. The one exception is local AI,
which only the desktop app installs.

## Story AI

**Story AI** (on the title screen's menu, and in Settings) decides who narrates the
world on your device:

- **A human Dungeon Master.** The app keeps the sheets, dice, maps and record; a
  person narrates. Works everywhere, no model needed.
- **Your own OpenAI API key.** The AI Dungeon Master and scene images run on OpenAI,
  billed to your key.
- **A local model** (desktop only). The app scans your GPU and memory, offers the
  Qwen3.6-35B-A3B tiers that fit (Q8 down to Q2, 12 to 45 GB) or a Gemma 4 12B
  fallback for smaller machines, and adds a small Qwen3.5-4B utility model for
  summaries when there is room. It downloads a pinned llama.cpp build (Vulkan on
  Windows and Linux x64, Metal on Apple Silicon), writes the preset the AI Dungeon
  Master was tuned on, and starts and stops the model with your world.

Scene art on desktop can come from a local ComfyUI the app installs into its own
Python virtual environment (it needs Python 3 on the machine) with the SDXL base
checkpoint, about 7 GB.

To play with an AI Dungeon Master on someone else's server, connect to a server
whose admin has set one up. Tables run by a human Dungeon Master work on every host.

## Servers and invites

- **Add a server** by its address. Each server keeps its own accounts, so you sign
  in or register there once; the app remembers the session.
- **Join with a code** takes a room code, an invite link, or a scanned QR code (the
  Android app scans with the camera). The code resolves through the broker to
  wherever that table's host is sharing from right now.
- **Invite links** (`odm://join?...`) open the app directly on desktop and Android;
  the web version of the link offers the app or the browser.
- Beside every server in the menu you can forget it on this device or delete your
  account there for good.

When you enter a host running server 0.21.0 or newer, the app draws the game screens
itself from the pages it ships, and forwards data calls, live updates, pictures and
downloads to the host with your session. Hosts from server 0.16.0 on are loaded
through the app's bundled screens as well (Settings has the switch for these older
worlds); anything older opens its own web pages inside the app.

## Updates

The desktop app checks for a new release when it starts and offers to install it.
Where it can, it installs the update itself and relaunches:

- **Windows installer, AppImage, `.tar.gz`, macOS:** replaced in place.
- **`.deb` / `.rpm`:** installed through your package manager, which asks for your
  password.
- **Flatpak:** the new bundle is downloaded and opened for your software center.
- **Store installs** (snap, or pacman through the AUR template in
  [packaging/aur](packaging/aur)) only announce the new version and leave the
  upgrade to that store.

On Android, install the new APK over the old one; your world and its data are kept.

## Building from source

### Requirements

- **Node 22+** and npm.
- **A checkout of the server repository beside this one**, at
  `../open-dungeon-master`, with its dependencies installed (`npm install` there).
  The build bundles the server's page components into the app, and
  `bundle-server` builds the embedded server from it. Point elsewhere with
  `ODM_SERVER_DIR=/path/to/open-dungeon-master`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lebbitheplow/open-dungeon-master.git
git clone https://github.com/Lebbitheplow/open-dungeon-master-client.git
(cd open-dungeon-master && npm install)

cd open-dungeon-master-client
npm install
npm run bundle-server   # builds vendor/server from a clean worktree at server HEAD
npm start               # builds and launches the desktop app
```

`bundle-server` rebuilds `better-sqlite3` for Electron's ABI, so rerun it after
changing Electron or the server. `vendor/server` is a build artifact and never
committed.

### Checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm test                        # builds, then node --test over tests/
npm run smoke-local             # boots the bundled server end to end
npm run smoke-relocate          # the server tree survives a move of the data folder
node scripts/smoke-tunnel.mjs   # a real share through the broker and cloudflared
```

There is no pull request CI beyond a security scan, so run these before opening a
pull request.

### Desktop packages

```bash
npm run dist:linux   # AppImage, deb, rpm, tar.gz
npm run dist:win     # NSIS installer
npm run dist:mac     # dmg and zip
```

Each one builds, stages `vendor/server` for packaging (`npm run stage-desktop`), and
runs electron-builder; output lands in `release/`. A Flatpak needs flatpak-builder
and the freedesktop runtime: `npx electron-builder --linux flatpak`.

### Android

The Android app is a Capacitor 7 project in [mobile/](mobile). You need the Android
SDK and **JDK 21** (Gradle fails under JDK 25). The Node runtime and `cloudflared`
for Android are prebuilt and published as releases of this repository:

```bash
cd mobile
npm ci
mkdir -p runtime
gh release download node-android-v24.20.0 --pattern '*.tar.gz' --dir runtime
gh release download cloudflared-android-2026.8.3 --pattern '*.tar.gz' --dir runtime
tar -C runtime -xzf runtime/node-android-v24.20.0.tar.gz
tar -C runtime -xzf runtime/cloudflared-android-2026.8.3.tar.gz

npm run sync             # builds the web assets and syncs Capacitor
npm run bundle-payload   # stages the server payload and runtimes into the app
cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

`npm run bundle-server` must have run at the repository root first; the payload is
built from `vendor/server`. To rebuild the runtimes themselves, see
[mobile/scripts/build-node-android.sh](mobile/scripts/build-node-android.sh) and
[mobile/scripts/build-cloudflared-android.sh](mobile/scripts/build-cloudflared-android.sh)
(Android NDK required). The mobile code has its own checks: `npm test` and
`npm run typecheck` inside `mobile/`.

## How the repository fits together

| Path | What lives there |
| --- | --- |
| [src/main](src/main) | Electron main process: the window, the embedded server (`local-server.ts`, `run-tree.ts`), sharing (`tunnel.ts`), the table registry, Bluetooth, the updater, and the local AI manager (`local-ai/`). |
| [src/preload](src/preload) | The bridge the shell and the game pages talk through, including `window.odmShell`. |
| [src/renderer](src/renderer) | The shell UI (title screen, servers, settings, guide, tour) and `game/`, which bundles the server's own pages with Preact shims and a runtime that routes their requests to the host. |
| [src/shared](src/shared) | Platform-free logic both apps share: invites and deep links, broker calls, portal rules, the home feed. |
| [mobile](mobile) | The Android app: the Capacitor bridge in `src/`, and the native world runtime, foreground service and tunnel in `android/`. |
| [scripts](scripts) | Build, bundling and smoke-test scripts. |
| [tests](tests) | Desktop unit tests, run with `node --test`. |
| [docs](docs) | Design notes, including [the desktop-Android bridge contract](docs/bridge-contract.md) that keeps the two apps in step. |

### Releases (maintainers)

Pushing a `v<version>` tag runs [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml): it
bundles the server from the server repository's `main`, builds every desktop target
plus the Flatpak, builds the signed Android APK and app bundle, and publishes them to
the release. Because CI builds from the server's `main`, push the server first when a
client release depends on server changes. The Android signing key comes from the
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` and `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
repository secrets. Keep `package.json` and `mobile/package.json` on the same version;
the Android upload refuses a tag that does not match.

## Privacy

Your world, its campaigns and its pictures live on your device. Nothing is sent
anywhere until you share a world, add a server, or choose an online Story AI:

- **Sharing** goes through a Cloudflare tunnel; the broker only issues the address and
  the TURN credentials for voice, and the tunnel closes when you stop sharing.
- **Servers you add** receive what you do on them, like any website.
- **OpenAI** receives the story prompts only if you pick your own OpenAI key as the
  Story AI. A local model keeps everything on your machine.

There is no telemetry.

## Credits and licenses

The apps are MIT licensed, like the
[Open Dungeon Master server](https://github.com/Lebbitheplow/open-dungeon-master),
whose README lists the credits and content licenses for the game itself. The desktop
app is built on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), the Android app on
[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/); sharing uses
[cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared), and local AI uses
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp),
[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), and models downloaded from
their publishers under their own licenses (Qwen, Gemma, Stable Diffusion XL).
