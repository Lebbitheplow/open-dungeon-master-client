// Finding a world that moved.
//
// A saved world is reached by its address, and a world one of the apps hosts
// gets a brand new address every time its host shares it again. The room code
// does not change, so the broker's table registry is the way back: it answers
// "the table with this code is at that address right now". This asks it, and
// then proves the world answering there is the same one before any saved
// session is handed over.
//
// That proof is not a formality. The play-CODE hostnames are minted per
// session and can later be handed to somebody else's world, so an address on
// file is not evidence of identity; only the world's own instanceId is. A
// shell that skipped the check could post a player's bearer token to a
// stranger's server.
//
// Pure orchestration over injected I/O, so both shells share it and the tests
// run under plain Node.
